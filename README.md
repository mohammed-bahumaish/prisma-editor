## 👋 Welcome to Prisma Editor, effortlessly visualize and edit Prisma schemas!

Prisma editor is a powerful tool to visualize and edit **[Prisma Schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema)**. You can easily create, modify and maintain complex database structures and be sure that your databases are organized and consistent.

With Prisma Editor, you can take advantage of a variety of incredible features, including real-time visualization, a user-friendly interface, SQL generation, and even the ability to edit your schema directly from the graph. But that's not all! We have also integrated the power of OpenAI's natural language processing API, which enables you to generate boilerplate schema code using natural language prompts.

  
**NOTE:** This is a community project, not associated with [Prisma](https://prisma.io).
